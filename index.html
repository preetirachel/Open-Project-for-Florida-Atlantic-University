C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972 
by Dennis M. Ritchie  to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language.  <br><br>

Advantages of C Language<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
<p>C language acts as a building block for many other currently used languages. C language 
has a variety of data types and powerful operators. Due to this, programs written in C language are efficient, fast and easy to understand.

<li>C is a highly portable language. This means that C pro
grams written for one computer can easily be run on another.

<li>There are only 32 keywords in ANSI C and its strength lies in its built-in functions.
 Several standard functions are available which can be used for developing programs. 
</p>
<li>
    Another important advantage of C is its ability to extend itself. A C program is basically a collection of functions that are supported by the
 C library. Due to the availability of large number of functions, the programming task becomes simple.</p>
<li>
    C language is a structured programming language. This modular structure makes program debugging, testing and maintenance easier.
